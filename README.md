# hdm-fully-grounding
Formalization of a fully grounding type inference algorithm for the HDM system

# Building
## Dependencies
This mechanisation has been tested with Coq versions 8.16.0 and 8.16.1. It
depends on Penn's Metalib library. Pull and follow instructions from
https://github.com/plclub/metalib .

## Building the project
The `_Coqproject` has been included in the repository. It should not be
necessary to touch this, but it can be regenerated by calling `./configure` in
the coq subdirectory.

Call `make` in the coq subfolder. Alternatively, to build in parallel, call
`make -j n` where `n` is the amount of threads on your machine

# Description of files
- coq:
  - Complete: definitions and theorems proving completeness
  - Cpdtlib: library, http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/ , exports `crush`
  - Defs: definitions and theorems about the system, not specific to either
    soundness or completeness
  - Libtactics: library,
    https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/LibTactics.html ,
    exports `inverts`, `splits`, `gen` etc. Excerpt from
    https://www.chargueraud.org/softs/tlc/ . Note that this mechanisation does
    **not** depend on the axioms declared.
